Title: The evolution of heterodimerising transcription factor networks.

Abstract:
Heterodimerisation of transcription factors and combinatorial control are features of gene regulatory networks especially in higher eukaryotes. Here I propose that these features could have been important mechanisms for the evolution of multicellular complexity. Random Boolean networks were used to model regulatory networks of dimerising and non-dimerising transcription factors. These networks were evolved in computer simulations to produce high numbers of steady states (attractors) which were interpreted as individual cellular states as found in different cell types. Simulations were run that either allowed dimerisation or did not. Dimerising networks evolved to produce a higher number of steady states, thus supporting the initial proposal.
